Our project is a simple example of Wordle game. The same user can play the game 1 time in 1 calendar day. The word to be known on the same calendar day is always the same word. The word to be played with test input can be selected. During the test game, statistics are not saved in the database and cannot be viewed later. The application is simple to use and can run on any computer. Some conditions must be met for it to work. First of all, the code must be opened with an ide on a computer with python installed. Then 'sqllite3', 'random', 'coloroma' and 'datetime' libraries should be installed.  All of these libraries are installed as standard with python. If not, you can install them by running "pip install 'library name'" on your command line.
